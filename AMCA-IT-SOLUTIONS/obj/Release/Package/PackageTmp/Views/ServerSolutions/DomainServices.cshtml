                    <p>The first step in creating a new website is choosing the right domain name. To establish your brand, you must first get this right. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">What is a <span>domain name?</span> </h2>
                    <p>In simple terms, your domain name is your website's name. Therefore, it is necessary to have a domain and hosting web service to view your domain name online.</p>
                    <p>There's no limit to how many letters and numbers can be in a domain name. Additionally, you can combine it with various domain extensions, including .com and .ae.</p>

Moreover, it is an asset whose value tends to increase over time.</p>
                    <p>So, Since the last twenty years, so many domains have been registered that most of the marketable and generic terms in the dictionary have already been registered. Therefore, it's highly probable that you won't be able to register for your first choice right now. Thus, the only option to obtain a precious business name is to buy a premium domain name before the registration expires and the owner is willing to sell it.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-title"><span>Benefits of</span> Domain</h2>
                    <p>Having your domain has many advantages for your business. Below are just a few of the most significant benefits:</p>
