                                <h3>PPC Contributes to Business Goals</h3>
                                <p>
                                    PPC advertising is often the best way to achieve your business goal. Many business and marketing objectives can be met through PPC. A hot lead submission or e-commerce sale is one example of high-level brand exposure and thought leadership.

                                    PPC can provide the middle ground of nurturing and serving the middle of the funnel by encouraging content downloads, contest entries, newsletter signups, and pushes for app downloads.

                                <h3>PPC Is Measurable & Trackable</h3>
                                <p>
                                    With Google Ads, it is straightforward to track and measure the results of PPC advertising. Combine Google Ads and Google Analytics for effective tracking and reporting. Depending on the defined business goals, you'll see details such as impressions, clicks, and conversions.
                                </p>

                                    There are vivid stats about how your campaigns are performing, what type of traffic they generate, and their results for your budget.

                                <h3>Quick Entry</h3>
                                <p>No matter how far behind your competitors, PPC marketing can get you up and running fast. Compared to SEO, Google Ads typically offers exact positioning and traffic within minutes of launch, which is a big difference from starting up SEO. Additionally, you can reach people who don't know your brand, unlike other email and organic social channels.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>You're in Control</h3>
                                <p>Default campaign settings are unique, but in the end, you have a great deal of control over how you reach potential customers. You can start with targeting keywords or placing ads in a restrictive way based on what you want to accomplish. Small budgets also give you more options. Ad budgets and bids can be set, and you can choose what you're willing to spend (though the price will be at least near the market level in most cases). The results can be scaled up immediately if they are positive. You can stop your advertising spending directly if you need a break.</p>

                                <h3>A Wealth of Marketing Data</h3>
                                <p>While you can access a lot of stats and performance information from Google Ads, the knowledge gained is worth more than just PPC performance. Content marketing and SEO strategies can be tailored based on impressions and clicks for each keyword. Furthermore, you can use our keyword planner and display planner tools to identify where your audience is. By monitoring your competition with the help of third-party tools, you can build up a solid profile of what you're up against and where you can gain market share. Of course, the search results can still be viewed manually to understand better what the average user will see.</p>
