                                <h3>It's cost-effective</h3>
                                <p>Cost-effectiveness is one of the significant benefits of SEM.</p>
                                <p>Advertising through traditional marketing methods, such as newspaper ads or billboards, allows you to reach people interested in your products. But unfortunately, these advertising methods are expensive and often don't offer the best return for your business.</p>
                                <p>Your marketing budget goes further with SEM. Your company's marketing efforts can be refined to reach the right people by not only controlling how much you spend and refining your targeting. For example, you display your ads near prospects looking for your products or services through keyword targeting.</p>
                                <p>Aside from that, you only pay for clicks on your ad - not people viewing it in search results. Therefore, you're paying for prospects that are likely to be interested in your product.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                <p>Keeping track of your campaigns is one of the main advantages of SEM. To ensure your marketing strategy drives results, you need to track it. With PPC, you can easily monitor your campaigns.</p>
                                <p>Changes are made quickly when tracking is easy. With an efficient tracking system, you will determine what is working and what is not. Furthermore, you can easily change your ad campaigns that are performing with fast results.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>It delivers fast results.</h3>
                                <p>The effectiveness of these strategies has to be seen through some marketing strategies, similar to SEO. However, even when a strategy like SEO is worth the wait, there are times when you just want to use strategies that yield results instantly.</p>
                                <p><i><strong>Introducing SEM.</strong></i></p>
                                <p>As soon as you place your paid ads, you can see how they perform. This lets you know what keywords generate the best results and who sees them. You can track the effectiveness of your ads right from the moment they launch with SEM.</p>
