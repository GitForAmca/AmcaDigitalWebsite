                                <h3>Stronger collaboration and organization</h3>
                                Content can be contributed and published by multiple team members using a CMS. Thanks to its workflow management, content storage, and scheduling capabilities, the system allows them to keep everything organized. With browser-based CMSs, you can access content from anywhere, and team members in different locations can work on the same documents in the same design and on the same version of the paper. Since the content is all stored in one location, team members can access it. Multiple files don't need to be sent to numerous people, and version control isn't a headache.
